SEO & AEO Quick Actions

What I changed (2025-10-04):
- Fixed JS errors and improved FAQ interactivity for better crawlability and UX.
- Added sitemap.xml (expanded to include main pages).
- Updated robots.txt to expose sitemap and block obvious sensitive paths.
- Added canonical link to `index.html` and a sitemap link in head.
- Added `loading="lazy"` to key images (logo + dynamically rendered logos).
- Added accessible FAQ markup and improved JS with ARIA and keyboard support.

Next recommended steps:
1. Verify sitemap in Google Search Console (submit / test URL).
2. Verify `robots.txt` in GSC (Robots Testing Tool).
3. Run Lighthouse / PageSpeed (Chrome DevTools) and fix LCP/CLS offenders.
4. Add missing alt text to any other images and compress them.
5. Create / populate `sitemap.xml` entries for blog articles (dynamic generation preferred).
6. Set up or verify GA4 + GSC property; enable site verification.
7. Create a Google Business Profile and collect reviews.
8. Start content plan: local landing pages, blog posts for target keywords, and FAQ expansion.

How to submit sitemap (quick):
1. Open Google Search Console, select your property.
2. Go to "Sitemaps" → enter `/sitemap.xml` → Submit.

If you want, I can:
- Generate meta/title improvements for top pages.
- Create a script to auto-generate sitemap from content.
- Run a Lighthouse audit and apply the top 5 fixes.
